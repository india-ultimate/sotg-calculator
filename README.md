### Copying and using the form template

- Make a copy of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q3Zr1IbbL6r87UpGkQ-D9hyJtw6cP8GlVLVRvFkVACU/edit#gid=1141649430" target="_blank_">the response sheet</a> by navigating to `File > Make a
  copy...`. (*NOTE:* You need to be signed into your Google account)
- From the copied spreadsheet, open the Google form by navigating to `Form >
  Edit form`
- Edit the form, as required
  - Change title, teams, etc.
    - Add any new questions if required
    - Do *NOT* change the existing questions
- Share the form URL of this edited form, to collect responses. If you have
  already collected responses using a "slightly" different form, you can use
  it, as long as it has all the required columns and is viewable by anybody
  with the URL.
- Go to Step #2 above, after responses have been collected

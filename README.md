# SOTG Calculator

An interactive web-app to manage spirit scores for a tournament.

## Motivation

In Indian Ultimate, SOTG winners are announced in the presentation ceremony
immediately after the finals of a tournament.

Spirit Directors feel immense pressure to double check the scores and
calculations and decide the winners in a short interval of time. Often they are
also playing in a tournament and it is a distraction from the games, especially
towards the end of the tournament.

This app automates the data processing and calculations to eliminate human
errors and also to free up mind-space for tournament Spirit Directors.

The app also lets Spirit Directors share Spirit scores with the teams through
out a tournament. Teams can see scores for all the games that they have already
self-scored. This lets teams adjust their behavior based on feedback.

You should use this tool if you want to

1) eliminate human errors
2) avoid worrying about calculating spirit ranks under a crazy time pressure
3) easily identify the teams to nudge to fill up the scores
4) share spirit scores with teams through out a tournament
